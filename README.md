# Accessible City App

This is the repository of the "Accessible City" app. The app is written in Flutter using Android Studio.

You should be able to clone this repository, open it in Android Studio, build and run it. There are probably many issues in doing so, but I have not encountered them (yet). Feel free to fork, improve and issue pull requests.
